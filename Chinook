#I'm going to work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.


#Info
#employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field 
named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
#customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.
SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
#The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table
stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
#artists table stores artists data.
#albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist.
However, one artist may have multiple albums.
#media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
#genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
#tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
#playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. 
The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.

#how Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'
Order by Country

#Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *

#Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
Select Cust.FirstName, Cust.LastName, Inv.InvoiceId, Inv.InvoiceDate, Inv.BillingCountry

Order by FirstName ASC

#Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
SELECT DISTINCT BillingAddress AS BillingCountry

#Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
